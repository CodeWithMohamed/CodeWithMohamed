### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub world! <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Earth.gif" width="24px">

### I'm Mohamed Mohamud, a full stack developer!

I'm currently looking for new opportunities after graduating from the School of Code! <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schoolofcode.co.uk%2F&psig=AOvVaw23MxNVnhGfHIIlq7f0O7qg&ust=1646933217568000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCNCrtb3GufYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD" width="24px">

After deciding to empower myself through code, I've completed the School of Code and now looking for a place where I can grow as a developer and a person. I also have a passion for making tech more accesssible to those from disadvantaged backgrounds!
